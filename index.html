                My name's Michelle, but a lot of my friends call me Meesh for short. I am a twenty-nine year old who
                works full time at an appliance parts store in Murfreesboro. I graduated MTSU with a Bachelors in Plant
                and Soil Science and a minor in Geology. I absolutely love plants, obviously, and I really love
                paleontology. (In fact I was going to talk about dinosaurs hopefully in one project through the year
                but you guys beat me to it.) I absolutely love dinosaurs, invertebrate fossils and stones. I enjoy
                being outside, if I can. Though, I do enjoy the activities I do inside, such as video games (mostly Pc
                but xBox for Monster Hunter World), movies (I love comic movies, Jurassic Park of course, LotR, Star
                Trek and others). TV shows are fun to binge too, such as Battlestar Galactica or SG-1/Atlantis.
                Though... my favorite show is Parks and Recreation. I channel a lot of Andy Dwyer. I am a goofy person,
                easy to talk to and honestly I try to be as kind as I can. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true. So
                I'd say I channel some Leslie Knope too. I have very animated facial expressions - my face decieves me
                on my emotions and/or thoughts. I once tried to control it and it was futile... I recently became a car
                person after buying my best friends Infiniti G35. I've slowly been working on fixing it up. I like
                reading sci fi and fantasy. Tolkien and Kristin Britain are my favorite authors. I suppose last, I have
                a wonderful family who has given me so much (mom, dad, two brothers). We have gone through quite a lot
                with my little brother being bi-polar; though, over all I would say that it's made me a much stronger
                and more understandable and patient person. I also have two dogs Cody and Butters) and a cat (Sal,
                who's snot is like cement) who are the light of my life. </p>

                Finding which dinosaur that was my favorite was actually difficult. I have been in love with dinosaurs
                since I was a little girl, which led to my obsession with the Jurassic Park Movies (what was incorrect
                about them, too) and consistent research. I narrowed it down to the dinosaur I do find myself to be the
                fondest of. This dinosaur is the ANKYLOSAURUS. I was excited to see that the first Jurassic World movie
                included the Ankylosaurus in their movie. If you remember, this dinosaur fought the Indominus Rex while
                the two brothers were in the Gyrosphere; unfortunately, the Indominus learned swiftly - like the raptor
                - and killed the Ankylosaurus by pushing it over to reach it's soft underbelly. The Ankylosaurus is a
                large herbivore dinosaur that had fused bone body parts to create a harder and stronger exterior, as
                well as better battle elements against predators. Those consisted of osteoderms (large armor plated
                like scales), spikes and spines on it's wide back, a large club on the end of it's tail and their
                skull. Those defense mechanisms (if you will) crushed bones. Though she is a rather slow moving
                creature, she could move fast in situations that required her to. They were also known to roam in
                packs, companionship to improve comfort levels. The Ankylosaurus was no taller than 5 feet in height,
                but she was known as the longest ankylosaurid at the average length of 18 feet. The first discovery of
                an Ankylosaurus was found in the Hell Creek Formation close to Gilbert Creek, Montana, by the
                paleontologist Barnum Brown in 1906. Ankylosaurs were around roughly 65-68 myo ago, ending in the
                Cretaceous period. Triceratops and the T-Rex were two of the other dinosaurs the Akylosaurus lived
                amongst. </p>
